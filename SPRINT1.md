## **Backend Achievements in Sprint 1**
### **Objective**
Librarians often face challenges in tracking the availability of books. Our project aims to integrate existing features and provide a more intuitive system for students and librarians to locate the resources they need efficiently.

| Feature                                    | Status  | Description |
|--------------------------------------------|---------|-------------|
| **Migration from Node.js to Golang**       | ✅ Done | Migrated from Node.js (Express.js) to Golang (Gorilla Mux) for better performance, maintainability, and scalability. Refactored API endpoints and database interaction layers. |
| **Database Schema Design & Implementation** | ✅ Done | Designed and implemented MySQL schema with `Users`, `Books`, and `BorrowingRecords` tables. Optimized database with indexes. |
| **User Authentication & Role Management**  | ✅ Done | Implemented JWT-based authentication, user registration, and login. Established Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for Students and Librarians. |
| **Backend API Testing & Debugging**        | ✅ Done | Used Postman for API testing. Fixed database schema mapping issues, MySQL column mismatches, and role validation logic inconsistencies. |

## **📌 Sprint 1 Goals (Ends on February 10th)**  
### **Goal:**
Establish the foundational system infrastructure, including environment setup and user management.

---

## **🛠 Key Tasks**

### **1️⃣ Project Environment & Database Structure**
- ✅ Set up the development environment and confirm the tech stack (front-end framework, back-end language, database type, etc.).
- ✅ Design an initial database schema, including core tables such as `Users`, `Books`, and `Borrowing Records`.

### **2️⃣ User & Role Management**
- ✅ Implement **registration, login, and authentication**, ensuring secure password storage (hashed passwords).
- ✅ Differentiate **user permissions** (e.g., Normal User vs. Admin), with corresponding access restrictions.
- ✅ Provide **logout functionality** and session-based or **JWT-based authentication**.

### **3️⃣ Initial UI and Navigation Layout**
- ✅ Define the overall **system layout** and **navigation scheme**, ensuring a seamless user experience.
- ✅ Set up **placeholder pages** and  **login page** or sections for upcoming functionalities, such as:
  - 📚 **Book Management**
  - 🏠 **User Center**
  - 📊 **Admin Dashboard**

---

## **📌 Next Steps**
- 🔜 Implement **Book Management**: CRUD operations for books.
- 🔜 Develop **Borrowing & Return Features**: Allow users to borrow and return books.
- 🔜 Improve **User Interface**: Enhance the frontend for better user experience.

---

### **📝 Notes**

-   Migration from **Node.js to Golang** was a major improvement in
    terms of **performance and scalability**.

-   Regular **weekly progress meetings** ensured smooth coordination
    among team members.

-   The **backend structure is now stable**, allowing us to focus on new
    feature development in Sprint 2.

---

## **✅ Summary**
Sprint 1 successfully laid the foundation for our **Library Management System**, including environment setup, authentication, and initial UI structure. Moving forward, we will focus on refining our features and implementing core functionalities.
