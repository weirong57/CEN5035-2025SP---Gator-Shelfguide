3.Description:
The current library management system provides some functionality, but it is not intuitive enough, making it inconvenient for students to use. Librarians also have difficulty tracking the availability of the books. Therefore, our project aims to better integrate existing features and provide a more intuitive way for students and Librarians to find the resources they need.

 

Our project addresses these shortcomings by integrating existing features into a cohesive and user-friendly interface, ensuring that both students and librarians can efficiently find and manage library resources. For students, our system introduces a more streamlined and visual approach to locating books, providing detailed information about book positions and availability. For librarians, enhanced tools for tracking and managing inventory will be implemented, significantly reducing their workload and improving resource management.Compared to typical search systems, our system makes it easier for students and librarians to locate book positions.
